    <h2>Lyrics:</h2>

    <pre>        Please don't stop the music, music, music
        Please don't stop the music, music, music
        Please don't stop the music, music, music
        Please don't stop the music, music, music

        It's getting late, I'm making my way over to my favorite place
        I gotta get my body moving, shake the stress away
        I wasn't looking for nobody when you looked my way
        Possible candidate, yeah

        Who knew, that you'd be up in here looking like you do
        You're makin' staying over here impossible
        Baby, I'm a say your aura is incredible
        If you don't have to go, don't

        Do you know what you started? I just came here to party
        But now we're rockin' on the dance floor, actin' naughty
        Your hands around my waist just let the music play
        We're hand in hand, chest to chest, and now we're face to face

        I wanna take you away
        Let's escape into the music
        DJ, let it play
        I just can't refuse it
        Like the way you do this
        Keep on rockin' to it
        Please don't stop the, please don't stop the music

        I wanna take you away
        Let's escape into the music
        DJ, let it play
        I just can't refuse it
        Like the way you do this
        Keep on rockin' to it
        Please don't stop the, please don't stop the, please don't stop the music

        Baby, are you ready 'cause it's gettin' cold
        Don't you feel the passion ready to explode?
        What goes on between us no one has to know
        This is a private show

        Do you know what you started? I just came here to party
        But now we're rockin' on the dance floor, actin' naughty
        Your hands around my waist just let the music play
        We're hand in hand, chest to chest, and now we're face to face

        I wanna take you away
        Let's escape into the music
        DJ, let it play
        I just can't refuse it
        Like the way you do this
        Keep on rockin' to it
        Please don't stop the, please don't stop the music

        I wanna take you away
        Let's escape into the music
        DJ, let it play
        I just can't refuse it
        Like the way you do this
        Keep on rockin' to it
        Please don't stop the, please don't stop the, please don't stop the music

        Please don't stop the music
        Please don't stop the music, music, music
        Please don't stop the music, music, music

        I wanna take you away
        Let's escape into the music
        DJ, let it play
        I just can't refuse it
        Like the way you do this
        Keep on rockin' to it
        Please don't stop the, please don't stop the music

        I wanna take you away
        Let's escape into the music
        DJ, let it play
        I just can't refuse it
        Like the way you do this
        Keep on rockin' to it
        Please don't stop the, please don't stop the, please don't stop the music

        Please don't stop the music
        Please don't stop the music, music, music
        Please don't stop the music, music, music, music, music, music, music</pre>
